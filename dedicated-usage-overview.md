## Create a VPC with an instance tenancy of dedicated<a name="creatingdedicatedvpc"></a>

When you create a VPC, you have the option of specifying its instance tenancy\. If you're using the Amazon VPC console, you can create a VPC using the VPC wizard or the **Your VPCs** page\.

If you launch an instance into a VPC that has an instance tenancy of `dedicated`, your instance is automatically a Dedicated Instance, regardless of the tenancy of the instance\.

## Change the tenancy of a VPC<a name="change-tenancy-vpc"></a>

You can change the instance tenancy of a VPC from `dedicated` to `default` after you create it\. Modifying the instance tenancy of the VPC does not affect the tenancy of any existing instances in the VPC\. The next time you launch an instance in the VPC, it has a tenancy of `default`, unless you specify otherwise during launch\.

**Note**  
You cannot change the instance tenancy of a VPC from `default` to `dedicated` after it is created\.

You can modify the instance tenancy of a VPC using the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the Amazon EC2 API only\.

------
#### [ Command line ]

**To modify the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [modify\-vpc\-tenancy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-tenancy.html) command and specify the ID of the VPC and instance tenancy value\. The only supported value is `default`\.

```
aws ec2 modify-vpc-tenancy --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d --instance-tenancy default
```
