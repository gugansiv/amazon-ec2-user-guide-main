# Amazon EC2 instance root device volume<a name="RootDeviceStorage"></a>

When you launch an instance, the *root device volume* contains the image used to boot the instance\. When we introduced Amazon EC2, all AMIs were backed by Amazon EC2 instance store, which means the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3\. After we introduced Amazon EBS, we introduced AMIs that are backed by Amazon EBS\. This means that the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot\.

You can choose between AMIs backed by Amazon EC2 instance store and AMIs backed by Amazon EBS\. We recommend that you use AMIs backed by Amazon EBS, because they launch faster and use persistent storage\.

**Important**  
Only the following instance types support an instance store volume as the root device: C3, D2, G2, I2, M3, and R3\.

For more information about the device names Amazon EC2 uses for your root volumes, see [Device names on Linux instances](device_naming.md)\.

## Root device storage concepts<a name="RootDeviceStorageConcepts"></a>

You can launch an instance from either an instance store\-backed AMI or an Amazon EBS\-backed AMI\. The description of an AMI includes which type of AMI it is; you'll see the root device referred to in some places as either `ebs` \(for Amazon EBS\-backed\) or `instance store` \(for instance store\-backed\)\. This is important because there are significant differences between what you can do with each type of AMI\. For more information about these differences, see [Storage for the root device](ComponentsAMIs.md#storage-for-the-root-device)\.

**Instance store\-backed instances**  
Instances that use instance stores for the root device automatically have one or more instance store volumes available, with one volume serving as the root device volume\. When an instance is launched, the image that is used to boot the instance is copied to the root volume\. Note that you can optionally use additional instance store volumes, depending on the instance type\.

Any data on the instance store volumes persists as long as the instance is running, but this data is deleted when the instance is terminated \(instance store\-backed instances do not support the **Stop** action\) or if it fails \(such as if an underlying drive has issues\)\.

![\[Root device on an Amazon EC2 instance store-backed instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/instance_store_backed_instance.png)

After an instance store\-backed instance fails or terminates, it cannot be restored\. If you plan to use Amazon EC2 instance store\-backed instances, we highly recommend that you distribute the data on your instance stores across multiple Availability Zones\. You should also back up critical data from your instance store volumes to persistent storage on a regular basis\.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance store](InstanceStorage.md)\.

**Amazon EBS\-backed instances**  
Instances that use Amazon EBS for the root device automatically have an Amazon EBS volume attached\. When you launch an Amazon EBS\-backed instance, we create an Amazon EBS volume for each Amazon EBS snapshot referenced by the AMI you use\. You can optionally use other Amazon EBS volumes or instance store volumes, depending on the instance type\.

![\[Root device volume and other Amazon EBS volumes of an Amazon EBS-backed instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ebs_backed_instance.png)

An Amazon EBS\-backed instance can be stopped and later restarted without affecting data stored in the attached volumes\. There are various instanceâ€“ and volume\-related tasks you can do when an Amazon EBS\-backed instance is in a stopped state\. For example, you can modify the properties of the instance, change its size, or update the kernel it is using, or you can attach your root volume to a different running instance for debugging or any other purpose\. 

If an Amazon EBS\-backed instance fails, you can restore your session by following one of these methods:
+ Stop and then start again \(try this method first\)\.
+ Automatically snapshot all relevant volumes and create a new AMI\. For more information, see [Create an Amazon EBS\-backed Linux AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md)\.
+ Attach the volume to the new instance by following these steps:

  1. Create a snapshot of the root volume\.

  1. Register a new AMI using the snapshot\.

  1. Launch a new instance from the new AMI\.

  1. Detach the remaining Amazon EBS volumes from the old instance\.

  1. Reattach the Amazon EBS volumes to the new instance\.

For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](ebs-volumes.md)\.

## Choose an AMI by root device type<a name="choose-an-ami-by-root-device"></a>

The AMI that you specify when you launch your instance determines the type of root device volume that your instance has\. You can view AMIs by root device type using one of the following methods\.

## Change the root volume to persist<a name="Using_RootDeviceStorage"></a>

By default, the root volume for an AMI backed by Amazon EBS is deleted when the instance terminates\. You can change the default behavior to ensure that the volume persists after the instance terminates\. To change the default behavior, set the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute to `false` using a block device mapping\.

## Change the initial size of the root volume<a name="change-root-volume-initial-size"></a>

By default, the size of the root volume is determined by the size of the snapshot\. You can increase the initial size of the root volume using the block device mapping of the instance as follows\.

1. Determine the device name of the root volume specified in the AMI, as described in [View the EBS volumes in an AMI block device mapping](block-device-mapping-concepts.md#view-ami-bdm)\.

1. Confirm the size of the snapshot specified in the AMI block device mapping, as described in [View Amazon EBS snapshot information](ebs-describing-snapshots.md)\.

1. Override the size of the root volume using the instance block device mapping, as described in [Update the block device mapping when launching an instance](block-device-mapping-concepts.md#Using_OverridingAMIBDM), specifying a volume size that is larger than the snapshot size\.

For example, the following entry for the instance block device mapping increases the size of the root volume, `/dev/xvda`, to 100 GiB\. You can omit the snapshot ID in the instance block device mapping because the snapshot ID is already specified in the AMI block device mapping\.

```
{
    "DeviceName": "/dev/xvda",
    "Ebs": {
      "VolumeSize": 100
    }
}
```
