# Spot Instance pricing history<a name="using-spot-instances-history"></a>

Spot Instance prices are set by Amazon EC2 and adjust gradually based on long\-term trends in supply and demand for Spot Instance capacity\.

When you request Spot Instances, we recommend that you use the default maximum price \(the On\-Demand price\)\. When your request is fulfilled, your Spot Instances launch at the current Spot price, not exceeding the On\-Demand price\. If you want to specify a maximum price, we recommend that you first review the Spot price history\. You can view the Spot price history for the last 90 days, filtering by instance type, operating system, and Availability Zone\.

**To view the current Spot prices**  
For the *current* Spot Instance prices, see [Amazon EC2 Spot Instances Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/)\.

**To view the Spot price history \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Spot Requests**\.

1. Choose **Pricing history**\. 

1. For **Graph**, choose to compare the price history by **Availability Zones** or by **Instance Types**\.
   + If you choose **Availability Zones**, then choose the **Instance type**, operating system \(**Platform**\), and **Date range** for which to view the price history\.
   + If you choose **Instance Types**, then choose up to five **Instance type\(s\)**, the **Availability Zone**, operating system \(**Platform**\), and **Date range** for which to view the price history\.
